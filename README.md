My name is Gustavo from Brazil. I'm currently working as a Data Analyst at [Viajar Faz Bem](https://www.sbtur.com).
I'm doing a degree in System Analysis and Development and also learning Back-end and Front-end since 2018. 

I speak Portuguese, English and trying to learn German.

Would you like to find me?
